I generally work in the area of systems. My research currently focuses on improving the reliability
and security of mobile systems by developing techniques at the intersection of mobile
computing, programming languages, and software engineering.

I received a B.S. degree in [Mathematics](https://math.yonsei.ac.kr/) from [Yonsei
University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/), an MS in [Computer Science and
Engineering](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/) from [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr/), and a
PhD in [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu) from [University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). I worked as a postdoc in the [Department of Computer
Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/).

Until 2020, I was with the [Department of Computer Science and
Engineering](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html) at the [University
at Buffalo, The State University of New York](https://www.buffalo.edu) as a (tenured) Associate
Professor.

**I am looking for new undergraduate, Master's, and PhD students as well as postdocs. If you are
